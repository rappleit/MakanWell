## Potential

Health mindfulness is on the rise. 76% of Singaporeans are more diet-conscious post pandemic. The Health Promotion Board has been on an aggressive campaign to promote healthy eating, giving out grants to support business aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles, wellness initiatives, and healthcare innovation. MakanWell has the potential to play a crucial role in mitigating the health crisis associated with unhealthy eating habits.

MakanWell can partner with local restaurants, food delivery platforms, and health-related organizations to expand our reach and influence, while our app promotes players in the industry that align with our mission.

## Scalability

Unhealthy eating habits and the desire for healthier alternatives are not unique to Singapore. While initially targeting the Singaporean market, with the current scale of AI technologies, we can expand our reach to the global market, catering to any cuisines, any eateries, and any diet.
